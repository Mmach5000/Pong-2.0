It's Pong, but with a twist. Every 15 seconds, one of 8 special event will start (list below). These events will make the game harder and more interesting, helping you beat your opponent, or lose for the tenth time.

List of events:
 - Fast Paddles: The players paddles will move much faster
 - Slow Paddles: The players paddles will move much slower
 - Fog: A thick fog covers the center of the screen, hiding the ball from view
 - Fire Ball: A red hot ball that moves much faster
 - Fast mode: Everything goes faster
 - Double Trouble: Double the balls, double the fun
 - Invisible Wall: An invisible wall that bounces the ball back to you
 - Random Ball: The ball will randomly change directions


Notes:
This game is made in Pygame. To play it locally, you need both Python and Pygame.
Some events will also increase the speed of the players paddles to make them easier.
The ball will not change directions when close to the wall in random ball.

Enjoy the game :)
